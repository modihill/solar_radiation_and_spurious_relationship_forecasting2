Forecasting Assignment 2

There are two tasks in this Report.

**1** Data: The monthly average Solar Radiatoin reaching the ground on perticular location over the globe as dependent variable for time series regression model and monthly Precipitation on the same location as an independent variable for time series regression model. The monthly time period is between January, 1960 and December, 2014.
 
  The main aim of the first task is to predict the amount of “Horizontal Solar Radiation” reaching the ground at perticular location over the globe for upcoming two years based on the time series analysis. Time Series Regression Models with independent variable “Precipitation”, dynlm, exponential smoothing and state-space models are used for this analysis. Then, the appropriate measures of resisual diagnostic checks and model performance measures MASE, AIC and BIC will be considered to find the best optimal model to predict the 2 years ahead forecast of “Solar Radiation”.

**2** Data: Quarterly Residential Property Price Index(PPI) and Quarterly Population change in victoria over the period of September 2003 and December 2016.

  The aim of the second task is to demonstrate whether the correlation between the Quarterly Residential Property Price Index(PPI) and Quarterly Population change in victoria is spurious or not.
